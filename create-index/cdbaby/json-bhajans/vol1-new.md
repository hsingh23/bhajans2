dance, but in vain, and a chataka bird waited for drops of water.
```

```
NB: It is told that the chataka bird will drink only raindrops as they
fall during the rains. It does not relish any other water. The idea
is that both the peacock and the chataka feel happy at the sight of
clouds but become miserable in the absence of the rain. Likewise,
waiting for God alone to make us happy seems to be in vain after
prolonged search and spiritual practice not yielding its fruit.

**jnanaman atma chaitanyam**

```
Renunciation is the real power on earth and world peace is the
real achievement in this world. Love is the effulgence and vigour
of this earth and knowledge its illumining soul.
```

**santarayi chintikya makkal irul**

**maranoli visidenam**

**tyagamen tanaten tennum dharikyanam**

**tyagattilalo visranti**

```
Children, please think it over peacefully; only light can remove
darkness. Grasp what is meant by renunciation, for only in that
there is complete rest.
```

**venam visvasam vinayam arkkum**

**venam manassin nadakkam**

**nana matangalum amme eka**

**sarattilekyayi nayippu**

**chitrakaran bhinnavar nangalal navya**

**chitran telikyunna pole**

**mitra manaru menorkku**

**svantam sukham tyajichanyarkku santapa**

**santiku payam tirayu**

the cost of your own comfort.
```

**onnil ninnonnu millanyam ellam**

**onninde bhinna tabhavam**

**anyane tannil ninnanyanayi kanukil**

**tannil ninnum tanumanan**

```
Nothing is separate from the Unity of Existence. All are but
diverse aspects of the same Truth. If you look upon someone
as separate from yourself, you are but alienating yourself from
yourself.
```

**cheyyunna karmangal ellam**

**eriya lerum nirasa**

```

of dharma (righteousness). If you perpetuate the evil desire for
ever new things, it will lead to disappointment.
```

**adaravayi pode venam loka**

**jivitam nam nayicchidan**

We should lead our life in this world with an attitude of reverence.
Be watchful in spirit and root out desires from the mind.
```

**tatvam grahikyunna buddhi bahya**

**svattil bhramikkilla tellum**

**chittum jadavum tiri chariyattavar**

**cattapol jivippu kastam**

```
The intellect which knows the Truth will not be swayed by
external wealth. Those who cannot discriminate between the
inert and the conscious are as good as dead.
```

**chaitanya matramanengum jadam**

**sadhu vallennal namukku**

**sadhan arambhattil venam valarchakkyayi**

**chijjada bhava vicharam**

```
Even though the world is naught but Consciousness and matter
does not matter at all, during the initial stages of spiritual
practice, a discriminating intellect is needed to differentiate
between the two for the sake of our growth.
```

**veda vedantangal ellam tannil**

**tane teliyum pakalpol**

**dhyana nilinam vilangunna cetassil**

**jnanamritam churannidum**
```
The Nectar of Knowledge will gush forth in the mind that is
absorbed in meditation and the Vedas and Upanishads will shine
forth of themselves from within as clear as daylight.
```

**antaralam chuttuniri daiva**

**chinta cheytandata nikku**

**tannullin ullil ullatma svarupanil**

fulfilled. For those who take refuge in Him with sincere devotion,
God is for them the Eternal Bliss Itself.

**trnavatkkarikkunnu yogi vrndam**

momentary enjoyment is considered as worthless as grass by
yogis.

**bhavatarini ni vetinnu vennal**

of fear, we have reached near Thy Feet. O Thou who takes us
across this Ocean of Becoming, if Thou forsake me, what for
should I live in this world?
```

**mrti bhayamengo marannu poyi**

**mrnmaya kantiyil asayum poyi**

**smara harakanti kalarnna ninmeyi**

crystallized and come as this unequalled beauty. And now the
tears are overflowing...

**kaliye mecchu karuttatu tanne**

```
O Thou who dwells in the middle of the Ocean of Milk, yet
ridiculed daily for stealing milk! How has Kanna's complexion
