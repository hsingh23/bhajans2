Ideas:
  create an add meta data modal
  consider removing supliements
    normalize names (remove, tags)
  click to show volumes (show by default on large screen)
  to make page load faster, we can pre compute searchable text
  total like counts - 
  bhajan categories
  add push notifications to 
    ask beta users to fillout feedback form
    remind users to visit the sites
    ask specific users to send/upload bhajans
    gamify liking bhajans

Get MUSIC
  Phase 1: UI
    support adding 1 song, add UI (preview song, and link to buy song)
  Phase 2: Automate
    get raw data
    for each bhajan in previous data
      normalize name
      add normalized name to addressed
    for each bhajan in raw data
      normalize name
      if normalized name !addressed
        search searchable name and if 1 match - add metadata
        if multiple mathes
          if one full match
            select
          else
            add to manually deal with normalized name
            [once dealt add the song to addressed]
